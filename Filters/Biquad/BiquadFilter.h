	y[n] = (b0/a0)*x[n] + (b1/a0)*x[n-1] + (b2/a0)*x[n-2] - (a1/a0)*y[n-1] - (a2/a0)*y[n-2] 
	
 
	H(z) = (b0/a0) * 1 + (b1/b0)*z^-1 + (b2/b0)*z^-2 /   1 + (a1/a0)*z^-1 + (a2/a0)*z^-2
 
 
	Fs (the sampling frequency)
 
	f0 ("wherever it's happenin', man."  Center Frequency or
	Corner Frequency, or shelf midpoint frequency, depending
	on which filter type.  The "significant frequency".)
 
	dBgain (used only for peaking and shelving filters)
 
	Q (the EE kind of definition, except for peakingEQ in which A*Q is
	the classic EE Q.  That adjustment in definition was made so that
	a boost of N dB followed by a cut of N dB for identical Q and
	f0/Fs results in a precisely flat unity gain filter or "wire".)
 
	_or_ BW, the bandwidth in octaves (between -3 dB frequencies for BPF
	and notch or between midpoint (dBgain/2) gain frequencies for
	peaking EQ)
 
	_or_ S, a "shelf slope" parameter (for shelving EQ only).  When S = 1,
	the shelf slope is as steep as it can be and remain monotonically
	increasing or decreasing gain with frequency.  The shelf slope, in
	dB/octave, remains proportional to S for all other values for a
	fixed f0/Fs and dBgain.
 
	A  = sqrt( 10^(dBgain/20) )
	   =       10^(dBgain/40)  
 
	w0 = 2*pi*f0/Fs
 
	alpha = sin(w0)/(2*Q)                                       (case: Q)
	
	= sin(w0)*sinh( ln(2)/2 * BW * w0/sin(w0) )           (case: BW)
	
	= sin(w0)/2 * sqrt( (A + 1/A)*(1/S - 1) + 2 )         (case: S)
 
	
	FYI: The relationship between bandwidth and Q is
	1/Q = 2*sinh(ln(2)/2*BW*w0/sin(w0))     (digital filter w BLT)
	or   1/Q = 2*sinh(ln(2)/2*BW)             (analog filter prototype)
 
	The relationship between shelf slope and Q is
	1/Q = sqrt((A + 1/A)*(1/S - 1) + 2)
 
	2*sqrt(A)*alpha  =  sin(w0) * sqrt( (A^2 + 1)*(1/S - 1) + 2*A )
	is a handy intermediate variable for shelving EQ filters.
