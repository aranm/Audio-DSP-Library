 Windowed Sinc FIR Generator

 Usage:
 Lowpass:	wsfirLP(h, N, WINDOW, fc)
 Highpass:	wsfirHP(h, N, WINDOW, fc)
 Bandpass:	wsfirBP(h, N, WINDOW, fc1, fc2)
 Bandstop:	wsfirBS(h, N, WINDOW, fc1, fc2)
 
 where:
 h (double[N]):	filter coefficients will be written to this array
 N (int):		number of taps
 WINDOW (int):	Window (W_BLACKMAN, W_HANNING, or W_HAMMING)
 fc (double):	cutoff (0 < fc < 0.5, fc = f/fs)
 --> for fs=48kHz and cutoff f=12kHz, fc = 12k/48k => 0.25
 
 fc1 (double):	low cutoff (0 < fc < 0.5, fc = f/fs)
 fc2 (double):	high cutoff (0 < fc < 0.5, fc = f/fs)
 
 
 Windows included here are Blackman, Hanning, and Hamming. Other windows	can be
 added by doing the following:
 1. "Window type constants" section: Define a global constant for the new window.
 2. wsfirLP() function: Add the new window as a case in the switch() statement.
 3. Create the function for the window
 
 For windows with a design parameter, such as Kaiser, some modification
 will be needed for each function in order to pass the parameter.
